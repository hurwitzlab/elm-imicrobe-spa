# iMicrobe Elm SPA 

Simple SPA iMicrobe.  Structured to handle each page as a separate module in a similar fashion to a MVC app. Made to be the bare minimum of a SPA but with a structure that can scale well.

This is basically a trimmed down version of the Elm [Real World](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example "Real World") example from Richard Feldman. So all credit to him.

## Get It Running

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
