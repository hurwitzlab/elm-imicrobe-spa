# iMicrobe Elm SPA 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hurwitzlab/elm-imicrobe-spa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hurwitzlab/elm-imicrobe-spa)

Simple SPA iMicrobe.  Structured to handle each page as a separate module in a similar fashion to a MVC app. Made to be the bare minimum of a SPA but with a structure that can scale well.

This is basically a trimmed down version of the Elm [Real World](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example "Real World") example from Richard Feldman. So all credit to him.

## Get It Running

```
elm package install
npm install
git clone git@github.com:hurwitzlab/imicrobe-landing-page.git plugins/landing-page
npm run build
npm start
```
